## Listing Pending Requests

Before responding, you may want to see pending requests.

Check your inbox using the `agent-messaging` skill. Filter for messages from ECOS-prefixed senders to find approval requests.

**Verify**: confirm you have reviewed all unread ECOS messages before proceeding.

## Message Format Sent

The command sends the following message to ECOS:

```json
{
  "to": "ecos",
  "subject": "EAMA Approval Response: {request_id}",
  "priority": "high",
  "content": {
    "type": "approval-response",
    "request_id": "{request_id}",
    "decision": "{decision}",
    "comment": "{comment}",
    "conditions": [],
    "responded_at": "{ISO-8601 timestamp}"
  }
}
```

## Error Conditions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Request ID not found` | Invalid or already-responded request ID | Check pending requests list |
| `Invalid decision value` | Decision not one of allowed values | Use: approved, rejected, needs-revision |
| `needs-revision requires comment` | Missing comment for revision request | Add --comment explaining what to change |
| `AI Maestro unavailable` | Messaging system not running | Start AI Maestro service |
| `ECOS not registered` | ECOS agent not in AI Maestro registry | Register ECOS agent |

## Prerequisites

1. **AI Maestro must be running**
   Verify AI Maestro health using the `agent-messaging` skill's health check feature.

2. **ECOS must be registered**
   Use the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill to list agents and confirm an ECOS agent is registered and active.

3. **Pending request must exist**
   Check your inbox using the `agent-messaging` skill and filter for unread ECOS messages.
