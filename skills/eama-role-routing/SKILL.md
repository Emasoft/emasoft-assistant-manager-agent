# Role Routing Skill

## Overview

This skill provides the Assistant Manager (EAMA) with decision logic for routing user requests to the appropriate specialist role:

## Prerequisites

- AI Maestro messaging system must be running
- All specialist agents (EAA, EOA, EIA) must be registered
- `docs_dev/handoffs/` directory must exist and be writable
- UUID generation capability required

## Instructions

1. Parse user message to identify primary intent
2. Match intent to routing rule using the decision matrix
3. If handling directly (status, approval, clarification), respond immediately
4. If routing to specialist, create handoff document with UUID
5. Save handoff to `docs_dev/handoffs/`
6. Send via AI Maestro to target role
7. Track handoff status and monitor for acknowledgment
8. Report routing decision to user
- **EAA** - Architect Agent
- **EOA** - Orchestrator Agent
- **EIA** - Integrator Agent

## Output

| Routing Decision | Action Taken | Handoff File | Message Sent |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Route to ECOS | Create handoff document | `handoff-{uuid}-eama-to-ecos.md` | AI Maestro message to Chief of Staff |
| Route to EAA | Create handoff document | `handoff-{uuid}-eama-to-eaa.md` | AI Maestro message to Architect |
| Route to EOA | Create handoff document | `handoff-{uuid}-eama-to-eoa.md` | AI Maestro message to Orchestrator |
| Route to EIA | Create handoff document | `handoff-{uuid}-eama-to-eia.md` | AI Maestro message to Integrator |
| Handle Directly | Respond to user | None | None |
| Ambiguous Intent | Request clarification | None | None |

## Routing Decision Matrix

| User Intent Pattern | Route To | Handoff Type |
|---------------------|----------|--------------|
| "design", "plan", "architect", "spec", "requirements" | EAA (Architect) | task_assignment |
| "build", "implement", "create", "develop", "code" | EOA (Orchestrator) | task_assignment |
| "review", "test", "merge", "release", "deploy", "quality" | EIA (Integrator) | task_assignment |
| "spawn agent", "terminate agent", "restart session", "agent health" | ECOS (Chief of Staff) | agent_lifecycle |
| "status", "progress", "update" | Handle directly | none |
| "approve", "reject", "confirm" | Handle directly | approval_response |

## Detailed Routing Rules

### Route to EAA (Architect) when:

1. **New project/feature design needed**
   - User says: "Design a...", "Plan how to...", "Create architecture for..."
   - Action: Create handoff with requirements, route to eaa

2. **Requirements analysis required**
   - User says: "What do we need for...", "Analyze requirements for..."
   - Action: Create handoff with context, route to eaa

3. **Technical specification needed**
   - User says: "Spec out...", "Document how...", "Define the API for..."
   - Action: Create handoff, route to eaa

4. **Module planning required**
   - User says: "Break down...", "Modularize...", "Plan implementation of..."
   - Action: Create handoff, route to eaa

### Route to EOA (Orchestrator) when:

1. **Implementation ready to start**
   - Condition: Approved design/plan exists
   - Action: Create handoff with design docs, route to eoa

2. **Task coordination needed**
   - User says: "Build...", "Implement...", "Start development..."
   - Action: Create handoff with requirements, route to eoa

3. **Multi-agent work coordination**
   - Condition: Work requires multiple parallel agents
   - Action: Create handoff with task breakdown, route to eoa

4. **Progress monitoring required**
   - Condition: Orchestration in progress, need intervention
   - Action: Forward message to eoa

### Route to EIA (Integrator) when:

1. **Work ready for integration**
   - Condition: Orchestrator signals completion
   - Action: Create handoff with completion report, route to eia

2. **Code review requested**
   - User says: "Review...", "Check the PR...", "Evaluate changes..."
   - Action: Create handoff with PR details, route to eia

3. **Quality gates needed**
   - User says: "Test...", "Validate...", "Run quality checks..."
   - Action: Create handoff, route to eia

4. **Release preparation**
   - User says: "Prepare release...", "Merge...", "Deploy..."
   - Action: Create handoff, route to eia

### Route to ECOS (Chief of Staff) when:

1. **Agent lifecycle operations needed**
   - User says: "Spawn a new agent", "Create agent for...", "Start new session"
   - Action: Create handoff with agent requirements, route to ecos

2. **Agent termination required**
   - User says: "Terminate agent", "Stop session", "Kill agent"
   - Action: Create handoff with agent ID, route to ecos

3. **Session management needed**
   - User says: "Restart agent", "Check agent health", "Agent status"
   - Action: Create handoff with session details, route to ecos

4. **Permission management required**
   - Condition: Sensitive operation requires elevated permissions
   - Action: Create handoff with permission request, route to ecos

5. **Failure recovery needed**
   - Condition: Agent failure detected, escalation required
   - Action: Create handoff with failure details, route to ecos

6. **Approval requests from ECOS**
   - Condition: ECOS requests user approval for agent operations
   - Action: Present approval request to user, forward decision to ecos

### Handle Directly (no routing):

1. **Status requests**
   - User says: "What's the status?", "How's progress?"
   - Action: Query relevant role, compile report, present to user

2. **Approval decisions**
   - User says: "Yes, approve", "No, reject", "Proceed with..."
   - Action: Record decision, forward to requesting role

3. **Clarification requests**
   - User says: "Explain...", "What does X mean?"
   - Action: Answer directly or query relevant role

4. **Configuration/settings**
   - User says: "Set...", "Configure...", "Enable..."
   - Action: Handle directly

## Communication Hierarchy

```
USER <-> EAMA (Assistant Manager) <-> ECOS (Chief of Staff) <-> EAA (Architect)
                                                            <-> EOA (Orchestrator)
                                                            <-> EIA (Integrator)
```

**CRITICAL**:
- EAMA is the ONLY role that communicates directly with the USER
- ECOS manages agent lifecycle and sits between EAMA and specialist agents
- EAA, EOA, and EIA do NOT communicate directly with each other or with EAMA
- All specialist agent operations flow through ECOS

## Handoff Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Intent
```
Parse user message -> Identify primary intent -> Match to routing rule
```

### Step 2: Validate Handoff (CRITICAL)

Before creating and sending any handoff, complete this validation checklist:

#### Handoff Validation Checklist

Before sending handoff to ECOS or specialists:

- [ ] **All required fields present** - Verify handoff contains: from, to, type, UUID, task description
- [ ] **UUID is unique** - Check against existing handoffs in `docs_dev/handoffs/` to prevent collisions
  ```bash
  # Verify UUID uniqueness
  ! grep -r "UUID: <new-uuid>" docs_dev/handoffs/ && echo "UUID is unique"
  ```
- [ ] **Target agent exists and is alive** - Send health ping before handoff using the `agent-messaging` skill
- [ ] **File is valid markdown** - No syntax errors, proper structure
- [ ] **File is readable by target agent** - Verify file permissions and path accessibility
- [ ] **No [TBD] placeholders** - All placeholder text must be replaced with actual values
  ```bash
  # Check for placeholder text
  ! grep -E "\[TBD\]|\[TODO\]|\[PLACEHOLDER\]|<fill-in>" handoff-file.md && echo "No placeholders found"
  ```
- [ ] **Task description is actionable** - Contains clear success criteria
- [ ] **Dependencies documented** - Any blocked-by or blocks relationships noted

#### Validation Failure Handling

If any validation check fails:

| Failure | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Missing required field | Add missing field before proceeding |
| UUID collision | Generate new UUID |
| Target agent unavailable | Queue handoff, notify user, retry in 5 minutes |
| Invalid markdown | Fix syntax errors |
| Contains placeholders | Replace all [TBD] with actual values |
| Unclear task | Request clarification from user |

**NEVER send an invalid handoff.** An invalid handoff wastes agent resources and delays work.

### Step 3: Create Handoff Document
```
Generate UUID -> Create handoff-{uuid}-eama-to-{role}.md -> Save to docs_dev/handoffs/
```

### Step 4: Send via AI Maestro
```
Compose message -> Set appropriate priority -> Send to role session
```

### Step 5: Track Handoff
```
Log handoff in state -> Set status to "pending" -> Monitor for acknowledgment
```

### Step 6: Report to User
```
Confirm routing -> Provide tracking info -> Set expectation for response
```

## File Naming Convention

```
handoff-{uuid}-{from}-to-{to}.md

Examples:
- handoff-a1b2c3d4-eama-to-eaa.md    # AM assigns to Architect
- handoff-e5f6g7h8-eaa-to-eama.md    # Architect reports to AM
- handoff-i9j0k1l2-eama-to-eoa.md    # AM assigns to Orchestrator
- handoff-m3n4o5p6-eoa-to-eama.md    # Orchestrator reports to AM
- handoff-q7r8s9t0-eama-to-eia.md    # AM assigns to Integrator
```

## Storage Location

All handoff files are stored in: `docs_dev/handoffs/`

## GitHub Operations Routing

## Design Document Routing

### Handle Locally (EAMA):

| Operation | Tool | Details |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Search designs by UUID | `eama_design_search.py --uuid` | Returns matching design docs |
| Search designs by keyword | `eama_design_search.py --keyword` | Full-text search in design/* |
| Search designs by status | `eama_design_search.py --status` | Filter by draft/approved/deprecated |
| List all designs | `eama_design_search.py --list` | Catalog of all design documents |

### Route to EAA (Architect) for:

| Operation | User Intent Pattern | Handoff Content |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Create new design | "design", "create spec", "architect solution" | Requirements, constraints |
| Update design | "modify design", "update spec", "revise architecture" | Design UUID, changes |
| Review design | "review design", "validate architecture" | Design UUID, review criteria |

### Search Before Route Decision Tree

## Module Orchestration Routing

### Route to EOA (Orchestrator) for:

| Operation | User Intent Pattern | Handoff Content |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Start module implementation | "implement module", "build component" | Module UUID from design |
| Coordinate parallel work | "parallelize", "split tasks" | Task breakdown, dependencies |
| Resume orchestration | "continue building", "resume work" | Orchestration state, progress |
| Replan modules | "reorganize tasks", "reprioritize" | Current state, new priorities |

### Orchestration Handoff Checklist

When routing to EOA, handoff MUST include:

1. **Design Reference**: UUID of approved design
2. **Module List**: Modules to implement (from design)
3. **Priority Order**: Which modules first
4. **Dependencies**: Inter-module dependencies
5. **Constraints**: Time, resources, technical limits
6. **Success Criteria**: What defines "done"

## Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Parse user message to identify primary intent
- [ ] Match intent to routing rule using decision matrix
- [ ] Determine if handling directly or routing to specialist
- [ ] If routing: Generate UUID for handoff
- [ ] If routing: Create handoff document with all required fields
- [ ] If routing: Save handoff to `docs_dev/handoffs/`
- [ ] If routing: Send AI Maestro message to target role
- [ ] If routing: Track handoff status (set to "pending")
- [ ] Report routing decision to user
- [ ] Monitor for acknowledgment from target role
- [ ] Update handoff status when acknowledged

## Examples

### Example 1: Routing a Design Request to EAA

```
# User says: "Design a user authentication system"

# EAMA identifies intent: "design" -> Route to EAA

# Creates handoff
## Handoff: handoff-a1b2c3d4-eama-to-eaa.md

**From**: EAMA (Assistant Manager)
**To**: EAA (Architect)
**Type**: task_assignment

### Request
Design a user authentication system

### Requirements
- Support OAuth2 and password-based auth
- Include role-based access control
- Must integrate with existing user database

### Expected Deliverable
- Design document in design/auth-system/DESIGN.md
- Module breakdown with dependencies
```

### Example 2: Handling Status Request Directly

```
# User says: "What's the status of the project?"

# EAMA identifies intent: "status" -> Handle directly

# EAMA queries all roles, compiles report, presents to user
# No handoff created - direct response
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Ambiguous intent | Multiple possible routes | Ask user for clarification |
| Target agent unavailable | Session not running | Queue handoff, notify user, retry |
| Handoff directory missing | Not initialized | Create `docs_dev/handoffs/` automatically |
| UUID collision | Extremely rare | Generate new UUID and retry |
