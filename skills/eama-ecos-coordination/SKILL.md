# ECOS Coordination Skill

## Overview

This skill enables the Assistant Manager (EAMA) to coordinate with the Chief of Staff (ECOS) component. ECOS acts as the operational coordinator that can either request approval for operations or operate autonomously within granted boundaries.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
1. ECOS agent is running or can be created
2. AI Maestro messaging is available
3. Approval workflow is understood

## Instructions

1. Identify coordination type needed
2. Send appropriate message to ECOS
3. Wait for acknowledgment
4. Process ECOS response

### Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Identify coordination type (create/grant/revoke/respond)
- [ ] Prepare AI Maestro message payload
- [ ] Send message to ECOS
- [ ] Wait for acknowledgment
- [ ] Process and log response

## Output

| Operation | Output |
|-----------|--------|
| Create ECOS | ECOS agent spawned, registered |
| Grant autonomy | Autonomy scope confirmed |
| Revoke autonomy | Autonomy revoked, ECOS notified |

## 1. What is ECOS and Its Relationship with EAMA

### Definition

ECOS (Emasoft Chief of Staff) is a coordination component that manages day-to-day operational tasks. It sits between EAMA and the specialized roles (Architect, Orchestrator, Integrator).

### Hierarchy

```
USER
  |
EAMA (Assistant Manager) - User's direct interface
  |
ECOS (Chief of Staff) - Operational coordinator
  |
+-- EAA (Architect)
+-- EOA (Orchestrator)
+-- EIA (Integrator)
```

### Responsibilities Split

| Component | Responsibilities |
|-----------|------------------|
| EAMA | User communication, final approvals, high-level decisions |
| ECOS | Task coordination, routine operations, delegation management |

---

## 2. Creating ECOS (EAMA Exclusive Responsibility)

EAMA is the ONLY agent authorized to create ECOS, ensuring single point of authority and role constraint enforcement.

See [creating-ecos-instance.md](references/creating-ecos-instance.md):
- When to create a new ECOS instance -> Section 1.3
- How to spawn ECOS with proper constraints -> Section 1.2
- Why only EAMA can create ECOS -> Section 1.1
- What to do after creating ECOS -> Section 1.4

---

## 3. Approval Request Flow from ECOS to EAMA

### When ECOS Sends Approval Requests

ECOS sends approval requests to EAMA when:

1. **Critical Operations**: Actions that affect production, security, or user data
2. **Policy Exceptions**: Operations outside delegated autonomy boundaries
3. **Resource Allocation**: Major resource commitments (time, budget, infrastructure)
4. **Conflict Resolution**: When specialized roles disagree on approach
5. **User-Impacting Changes**: Any change that affects user experience

### Request Categories

| Category | Description | Default: Requires EAMA Approval |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `critical-operation` | Production deployments, database migrations | Always |
| `policy-exception` | Deviation from standard procedures | Always |
| `resource-allocation` | Budget, infrastructure, timeline changes | Always |
| `conflict-resolution` | Inter-role disagreements | Always |
| `routine-operation` | Standard development tasks | Delegatable |
| `minor-decision` | Low-impact choices | Delegatable |

---

## 4. Responding to ECOS Approval Requests

EAMA responds with: `approved`, `rejected`, or `needs-revision`. The response includes request_id, decision, optional comment, and conditions.

See [approval-response-workflow.md](references/approval-response-workflow.md):
- When ECOS sends an approval request -> Section 1
- How to format the response message -> Section 2
- What evaluation criteria to use -> Section 3
- When to escalate to user -> Section 3

---

## 5. Delegation Rules for Autonomous Operation

Autonomous mode allows ECOS to proceed with certain operation types without requesting approval for each one. EAMA controls delegation via grant/revoke messages.

See [delegation-rules.md](references/delegation-rules.md):
- When to grant autonomous mode to ECOS -> Section 2
- How to configure delegation rules -> Section 2
- When to revoke autonomous mode -> Section 3
- What operations always require approval -> Section 4

---

## 6. AI Maestro Message Formats for ECOS Communication

All ECOS coordination happens via AI Maestro messages with specific JSON formats.

See [message-formats.md](references/message-formats.md):
- When formatting an approval request from ECOS -> Section 1
- When formatting an approval response from EAMA -> Section 2
- When formatting an autonomy grant/revoke message -> Section 3
- When formatting a completion notification -> Section 4

---

## 7. Completion Notifications from ECOS

ECOS notifies EAMA when operations complete. User notification depends on operation type and user preferences.

See [completion-notifications.md](references/completion-notifications.md):
- When ECOS sends completion notifications -> Section 1
- How to process completion notifications -> Section 2
- When to notify the user about completions -> Section 3

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| ECOS not found | No response to messages | Verify ECOS session exists, create if needed |
| Message send failure | AI Maestro API error | Check AI Maestro service status |
| Invalid approval format | ECOS rejects response | Review message format in Section 4 |
| Autonomy grant failed | ECOS doesn't acknowledge grant | Verify ECOS has latest plugin version |
| Duplicate request ID | Request ID collision | Use unique UUID for each request |

### Error Scenarios

| Error | Cause | EAMA Action |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| ECOS unresponsive | ECOS session crashed or network issue | Alert user, attempt restart |
| Request timeout | EAMA took too long to respond | Auto-escalate to user |
| Invalid request format | Malformed message from ECOS | Return error, request retry |
| Scope exceeded | ECOS attempted unauthorized operation | Revoke autonomy, alert user |
| Conflicting requests | Multiple requests for same resource | Queue and resolve sequentially |

### Escalation to User

EAMA escalates to user when:

1. Cannot make autonomous decision
2. Request involves user-defined critical operations
3. ECOS reports critical failure
4. Security concern detected
5. Request timeout approaching

### Audit Trail

All ECOS interactions are logged:

```yaml
ecos_audit_log:
  - timestamp: "ISO-8601"
    event_type: "request|response|grant|revoke|complete"
    request_id: "ecos-req-{uuid}"
    details: "Event description"
    user_involved: true|false
```

- When handling a deployment approval request -> Example 1
- When granting autonomous mode for development -> Example 2
- When processing a completion notification -> Example 3

## Message Acknowledgment Protocol

All messages sent to ECOS require acknowledgment (ACK) to ensure reliable communication. Different message types have different ACK timeout requirements.

### ACK Timeout Requirements

| Message Type | ACK Timeout | Retry Behavior | Escalation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Approval decisions | 30 seconds | Retry once after timeout | Escalate to user if no ACK after retry |
| Work requests | 60 seconds | Retry once after timeout | Escalate to user if no ACK after retry |
| Health check pings | 60 seconds | No retry | Log as unresponsive |
| Status queries | 30 seconds | Retry once after timeout | Report timeout to user |
| Autonomy grant/revoke | 30 seconds | Retry once after timeout | Escalate to user if no ACK after retry |

### ACK Message Format

ECOS must respond with an ACK message within the timeout period:

```json
{
  "from": "ecos-<project-name>",
  "to": "eama-assistant-manager",
  "subject": "ACK: <original-subject>",
  "priority": "normal",
  "content": {
    "type": "ack",
    "original_message_id": "<message-id>",
    "status": "received|processing|completed",
    "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>"
  }
}
```

### Handling Missing ACK

**Step 1: Wait for Timeout**
- Start timer when message is sent
- Check inbox for ACK message at timeout

**Step 2: Retry Once**
```bash
# Resend message with retry flag
curl -X POST "$AIMAESTRO_API/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "eama-assistant-manager",
    "to": "ecos-<project-name>",
    "subject": "RETRY: <original-subject>",
    "priority": "high",
    "content": {
      "type": "<original-type>",
      "retry_of": "<original-message-id>",
      "retry_count": 1,
      ...original content...
    }
  }'
```

**Step 3: Escalate if Still No ACK**
If no ACK after retry:

1. **Log the failure** in `docs_dev/sessions/ack-failures.md`
2. **Alert the user**:
   ```
   ECOS Communication Failure

   Message: <subject>
   Sent: <timestamp>
   Retry: <retry-timestamp>
   Status: No acknowledgment received

   ECOS may be unresponsive. Options:
   - [Check ECOS Health] - Send health ping
   - [Retry Again] - Send message again
   - [Respawn ECOS] - Terminate and recreate ECOS session
   ```
3. **Do not assume message was processed** - treat as failed delivery

### ACK Verification Checklist

- [ ] Message sent with unique message ID
- [ ] Timer started at send time
- [ ] ACK received within timeout period
- [ ] ACK references correct original message ID
- [ ] ACK status recorded in communication log
