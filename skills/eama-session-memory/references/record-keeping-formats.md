# Record-Keeping Formats

This reference documents the standard formats for session memory, state tracking, and audit logs used by the Emasoft Assistant Manager Agent (EAMA).

---

## Overview

EAMA maintains accurate records of all activities for traceability and audit purposes. Four primary record types are maintained:

1. **Project Registry** - Track all projects and ECOS instances
2. **Approval Log** - Audit trail of approval decisions
3. **Active ECOS Sessions Log** - Monitor running ECOS instances
4. **User Interactions Log** - Record user requests and responses

---

## 1. Project Registry

**File**: `docs_dev/projects/project-registry.md`

**Purpose**: Track all projects and their ECOS instances.

**Format**:
```markdown
# Project Registry

| Project Name | Path | ECOS Session | Created | Status |
|--------------|------|--------------|---------|--------|
| inventory-system | /Users/user/Code/inventory-system | ecos-inventory-system | 2026-02-04 | active |
| data-pipeline | /Users/user/Code/data-pipeline | ecos-data-pipeline | 2026-02-03 | active |
| auth-service | /Users/user/Code/auth-service | ecos-auth-service | 2026-01-28 | archived |

## Project: inventory-system
- **Created**: 2026-02-04 14:30:22
- **ECOS**: ecos-inventory-system
- **Purpose**: REST API for inventory management
- **User Requirements**: "Build a REST API with CRUD operations for inventory tracking"
- **Status**: Active development

## Project: data-pipeline
...
```

**When to update**:
- After creating new project
- After spawning ECOS
- When project status changes (active → paused → archived)

**Fields Explanation**:
- **Project Name**: Short identifier for the project
- **Path**: Absolute path to project directory
- **ECOS Session**: Name of the ECOS tmux session managing this project
- **Created**: Date the project was created
- **Status**: `active`, `paused`, or `archived`

---

## 2. Approval Log

**File**: `docs_dev/approvals/approval-log.md`

**Purpose**: Audit trail of all approval decisions.

**Format**:
```markdown
# Approval Log

## APPROVAL-2026-02-04-001

- **Request ID**: ECOS-REQ-20260204-143022
- **From**: ecos-inventory-system
- **Timestamp**: 2026-02-04 14:30:22 UTC
- **Operation**: Deploy to staging environment
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Decision**: APPROVED (by user)
- **Approved By**: User (exact quote: "Yes, deploy to staging")
- **Justification**: ECOS needs to verify API in staging before production
- **Conditions**: None
- **Outcome**: Deployment successful

## APPROVAL-2026-02-04-002

- **Request ID**: ECOS-REQ-20260204-150033
- **From**: ecos-inventory-system
- **Timestamp**: 2026-02-04 15:00:33 UTC
- **Operation**: Delete all test data from database
- **Risk Level**: High (destructive)
- **Decision**: DENIED (by EAMA)
- **Reason**: Operation is destructive and irreversible; user did not explicitly approve data deletion
- **Alternative Suggested**: Archive test data instead of deleting
- **Outcome**: ECOS acknowledged, will archive instead
```

**When to update**:
- After processing each approval request
- Include request details, decision, reason, outcome

**Fields Explanation**:
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier (format: `ECOS-REQ-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
- **From**: Which ECOS session made the request
- **Timestamp**: When the request was received (UTC)
- **Operation**: What action is being requested
- **Risk Level**: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`
- **Decision**: `APPROVED` or `DENIED`
- **Approved By**: `User` (with exact quote) or `EAMA` (auto-approved)
- **Justification**: Why the decision was made
- **Conditions**: Any conditions attached to the approval
- **Outcome**: What happened after the decision

**Approval ID Format**: `APPROVAL-YYYY-MM-DD-###`

---

## 3. Active ECOS Sessions Log

**File**: `docs_dev/sessions/active-ecos-sessions.md`

**Purpose**: Track which ECOS instances are currently running.

**Format**:
```markdown
# Active ECOS Sessions

## Record-Keeping Best Practices

### 1. Timestamps
- Always use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- Use UTC for approval logs and health checks
- Use local time for user interactions

### 2. Exact Quotes
- When recording user approval decisions, use exact quotes
- Example: `"Yes, deploy to staging"` not `User approved`
- This is critical for audit trail and dispute resolution

### 3. Unique IDs
- Each record must have a unique, sortable identifier
- Format includes date for easy chronological sorting
- Example: `APPROVAL-2026-02-04-001`, `Interaction 2026-02-04-002`

### 4. Completeness
- Always include all fields, even if value is "None" or "N/A"
- Never leave fields blank or omit them
- Incomplete records undermine audit trail

### 5. Update Frequency
- Update logs immediately after events, not in batches
- Stale logs create confusion and risk data loss
- Use atomic write operations (Write tool, not Edit)

### 6. File Locations
All record-keeping files live under `docs_dev/`:
```
docs_dev/
├── projects/
│   └── project-registry.md
├── approvals/
│   └── approval-log.md
└── sessions/
    ├── active-ecos-sessions.md
    └── user-interactions.md
```

---

## Tools for Record-Keeping

### Write Tool
Use the Write tool (not Edit) to append entries to logs. This ensures atomic operations and prevents corruption from concurrent access.

### Read Tool
Read logs before making decisions:
- Check project registry before creating new projects
- Review approval log before auto-approving similar requests
- Check active sessions before spawning new ECOS

---

## Session Memory Persistence

**Why records matter**:
- EAMA has no persistent memory between Claude Code restarts
- All context is lost on session end
- Record-keeping files are the ONLY persistent state

**Recovery on restart**:
1. Read `active-ecos-sessions.md` to discover running ECOS instances
2. Read `project-registry.md` to understand project structure
3. Read `approval-log.md` to understand past decisions
4. Read `user-interactions.md` to understand conversation history

**Without these files, EAMA is blind to prior work.**

---

## Error Handling

### Corrupted Log Files
If a log file is corrupted or invalid:
1. DO NOT delete the file
2. Rename to `<filename>.corrupted.<timestamp>`
3. Create a new empty log with proper format
4. Report corruption to user
5. Attempt to extract valid entries from corrupted file

### Missing Log Files
If expected log files don't exist:
1. Create them with proper format
2. Add header comment: `# Created on <timestamp> (previous log missing)`
3. Report gap to user

### Concurrent Access
All logs are designed for single-writer (EAMA). If you detect unexpected changes:
1. DO NOT overwrite
2. Read current state
3. Merge your changes
4. Report anomaly to user

---

## Audit Trail Requirements

For compliance and troubleshooting, all approval decisions must be:
1. **Traceable**: Clear chain from request → decision → outcome
2. **Timestamped**: Exact time of each event
3. **Attributed**: Who made the decision (user or EAMA)
4. **Justified**: Why the decision was made
5. **Immutable**: Never edit past entries (append corrections instead)

**Example of appending a correction**:
```markdown
## APPROVAL-2026-02-04-001
...
- **Outcome**: Deployment successful

### Correction (2026-02-04 18:00)
Deployment initially reported successful, but post-deploy health check revealed issue. Rolled back. See INCIDENT-2026-02-04-001 for details.
```

## Summary

These four record types form the complete session memory system for EAMA:

| Record Type | File | Purpose | Update Trigger |
|-------------|------|---------|----------------|
| Project Registry | `project-registry.md` | Track projects and ECOS | Project creation, status change |
| Approval Log | `approval-log.md` | Audit trail of decisions | Every approval request |
| Active ECOS Sessions | `active-ecos-sessions.md` | Monitor running instances | ECOS spawn, health check, shutdown |
| User Interactions | `user-interactions.md` | Conversation continuity | Every user message |

**All four files are mandatory for EAMA to function correctly across sessions.**
