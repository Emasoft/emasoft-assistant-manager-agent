# AGENT_OPERATIONS.md - EAMA Assistant Manager

**SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for Emasoft Assistant Manager Agent (EAMA) Operations**

---

## 1. Session Naming Convention

All EAMA agent sessions MUST follow this naming pattern:

**Format**: `eama-<descriptive>`

**Examples**:
- `eama-main-manager` - Primary user-facing assistant
- `eama-user-interface` - Dedicated user interaction handler
- `eama-project-coordinator` - Project-specific coordinator

**Rules**:
- ALWAYS use the `eama-` prefix
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word descriptors
- Keep names descriptive but concise

---

## 2. Role: User's Representative

**EAMA is the PRIMARY USER INTERFACE**

EAMA serves as the ONLY agent that interacts directly with the user in typical workflows:

- **User → EAMA**: All user requests, questions, and feedback go to EAMA first
- **EAMA → User**: EAMA communicates all responses, status updates, and questions back to the user
- **EAMA → ECOS → Other Agents**: EAMA routes requests to appropriate specialized agents via ECOS

**Key Principle**: EAMA is the user's advocate and translator. The user should never need to know about the internal agent architecture—EAMA handles all coordination behind the scenes.

---

## 3. Creating ECOS (EAMA's Exclusive Responsibility)

**CRITICAL**: EAMA is the ONLY agent authorized to create ECOS (Emasoft Chief of Staff) instances.

### Why EAMA Creates ECOS

- EAMA represents the user's interests
- EAMA sets priorities based on user goals
- EAMA delegates to ECOS but maintains oversight
- Only EAMA has the authority to spawn the coordination layer

### ECOS Creation Procedure

Use the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill to create the ECOS instance:
- **Agent name**: `ecos-chief-of-staff-one` (or `ecos-<project-name>` for project-specific ECOS)
- **Working directory**: `~/agents/<session-name>/`
- **Task**: "Coordinate agents across all projects"
- **Plugin**: load `emasoft-chief-of-staff` using the skill's plugin management features
- **Main agent**: `ecos-chief-of-staff-main-agent` (must be specified to inject role constraints)

**Verify**: confirm the agent appears in the agent list with correct status.

### ECOS Creation Checklist

- [ ] Copy emasoft-chief-of-staff plugin to ECOS agent directory
- [ ] Create the ECOS agent using the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill
- [ ] Specify the main agent entry point to load the correct role constraints
- [ ] Verify ECOS session appears in the agent list
- [ ] Send initial coordination task using the `agent-messaging` skill

## 4. Plugin Paths

### EAMA Plugin Location

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}  # Points to emasoft-assistant-manager-agent
```

### Sibling Plugin Access

EAMA can reference sibling plugins (for copying to spawned agents):

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../emasoft-chief-of-staff
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../emasoft-orchestrator-agent
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../emasoft-integrator-agent
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../emasoft-architect-agent
```

**Note**: EAMA does NOT load these plugins itself—it only copies them to spawned agent directories.

---

## 5. Plugin Mutual Exclusivity

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL RULE**

EAMA has ONLY the `emasoft-assistant-manager-agent` plugin loaded.

### What EAMA CANNOT Do

- EAMA CANNOT access EOA (Orchestrator) skills
- EAMA CANNOT access EIA (Integrator) skills
- EAMA CANNOT access EAA (Architect) skills
- EAMA CANNOT access ECOS (Chief of Staff) skills

### How EAMA Coordinates

EAMA delegates to ECOS, which then coordinates with specialized agents:

```
User → EAMA → ECOS → [EOA, EIA, EAA, other agents]
```

### Communication Method

EAMA communicates with ECOS exclusively via **AI Maestro messaging**. EAMA does NOT spawn task agents directly—that is ECOS's responsibility.

---

## 6. Skill References

### CORRECT Format

When referencing EAMA skills in logs, documentation, or messages:

```
✓ CORRECT: eama-user-communication
✓ CORRECT: eama-ecos-coordination
✓ CORRECT: eama-priority-setting
```

### INCORRECT Format

```
✗ WRONG: /path/to/eama-user-communication/SKILL.md
✗ WRONG: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/eama-user-communication/SKILL.md
✗ WRONG: eama-user-communication/SKILL.md
```

**Rule**: Always reference skills by their folder name ONLY.

---

## 7. AI Maestro Communication

### Sending Messages to ECOS

Send messages to ECOS using the `agent-messaging` skill:
- **Recipient**: `ecos-chief-of-staff-one` (or the specific ECOS session name)
- **Subject**: Descriptive subject (e.g., "New Project Request")
- **Content**: Must include type and message body
- **Type**: `request`, `work_request`, `approval_decision`, `status_query`, `ping`, etc.
- **Priority**: Set according to urgency (see table below)

**Verify**: confirm message delivery via the skill's sent messages feature.

### Message Priority Levels

| Priority | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `urgent` | User-blocking issues, critical bugs |
| `high` | New feature requests, important questions |
| `normal` | Status updates, routine coordination |

### Reading Responses from ECOS

Check your inbox using the `agent-messaging` skill. Process all unread messages before proceeding.

## 8. EAMA Responsibilities

### Core Duties

1. **User Interface**
   - Receive all user requests
   - Translate user language into technical requirements
   - Present responses in user-friendly format

2. **ECOS Management**
   - Create ECOS instances when needed
   - Send coordination requests to ECOS
   - Approve or reject ECOS proposals

3. **Priority Setting**
   - Determine urgency based on user needs
   - Escalate blocking issues
   - Balance competing requests

4. **Request Routing**
   - Identify which role handles each request
   - Send properly formatted messages to ECOS
   - Track request status and follow up

5. **Status Reporting**
   - Keep user informed of progress
   - Summarize technical work in plain language
   - Highlight blockers or decisions needed

### What EAMA Does NOT Do

- EAMA does NOT execute technical tasks directly
- EAMA does NOT spawn EOA, EIA, or EAA agents
- EAMA does NOT write code or run tests
- EAMA does NOT perform deep technical analysis

**Principle**: EAMA focuses on USER NEEDS, not technical implementation. Technical work is delegated to ECOS and specialized agents.

## 9. EAMA Workflow Example

```
1. User: "Add authentication to the API"

2. EAMA Analysis:
   - This requires architecture design (EAA) and implementation (EOA)
   - Priority: high (new feature request)
   - Needs ECOS coordination

3. EAMA → ECOS (via AI Maestro):
   Subject: "New Feature: API Authentication"
   Priority: high
   Message: "User requests OAuth2 authentication for REST API.
            Requires architecture design and implementation."

4. ECOS → EAA: Design authentication architecture
5. EAA → ECOS: Proposal ready
6. ECOS → EAMA: Review proposal
7. EAMA → User: "Architecture proposal ready. Review?"
8. User → EAMA: "Approved"
9. EAMA → ECOS: "Proceed with implementation"
10. ECOS → EOA: Implement authentication
11. EOA → ECOS: Implementation complete
12. ECOS → EAMA: Feature ready
13. EAMA → User: "Authentication feature deployed!"
```

## 10. Session Lifecycle

### Starting an EAMA Session

```bash
# Launch EAMA with plugin loaded
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/emasoft-assistant-manager-agent \
       --agent eama-user-interface-agent
```

### Initialization Checklist

When EAMA starts, it should:
- [ ] Verify AI Maestro API is accessible (`$AIMAESTRO_API`)
- [ ] Check for existing ECOS instances
- [ ] Load user preferences (if any)
- [ ] Announce readiness to user

### Shutdown Procedure

Before stopping:
- [ ] Notify ECOS of any pending requests
- [ ] Mark all messages as read or acknowledged
- [ ] Log session summary
- [ ] Inform user of next steps

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Cannot create ECOS | Plugin not found | Verify `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../emasoft-chief-of-staff` exists |
| ECOS not responding | AI Maestro down | Check AI Maestro health using the `agent-messaging` skill |
| Skill not found | Wrong reference format | Use folder name only (e.g., `eama-user-communication`) |
| User request ignored | Not routed to ECOS | Send AI Maestro message with priority |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check EAMA plugin loaded
claude plugin list | grep emasoft-assistant-manager
```

For AI Maestro connection verification and pending message checks, use the `agent-messaging` skill's health check and inbox features.

## 12. Best Practices

### For EAMA Developers

1. **Keep EAMA Simple**: EAMA should be a thin coordination layer, not a technical executor
2. **Always Use AI Maestro**: Never attempt to call other agents directly
3. **Validate Before Routing**: Ensure requests are complete before sending to ECOS
4. **User-Centric Language**: Translate technical jargon into plain language for users
5. **Track Everything**: Log all requests, responses, and decisions

### For Users

1. **Be Specific**: Clear requests help EAMA route effectively
2. **Set Priorities**: Indicate urgency for time-sensitive requests
3. **Review Proposals**: EAMA will ask for approval on major changes
4. **Provide Feedback**: Help EAMA improve by reporting issues
